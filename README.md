# Find Gomory Hu cut tree for an undirected graph

Input:
Number of nodes
Number of edges
Capacity of each edge 

Output:
Cut tree consisting of the nodes and their corresponding maxflow.

Explanation:- The program is used to find the smallest capacity unique path between any two vertices of an undirected graph. The minimum cut between the source and sink is found using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
